- ### Neovim
  I just recently decided to start using vim motions and now decided to force myself to migrate.
  So thanks to [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) that helped me to take this first step.
  #### For c/c++ on debian/ubuntu
  You might need to install:
  
  `sudo apt install clangd-15`

  `sudo apt install libstdc++-12-dev`
